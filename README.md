# HamiltonianSnakeBot
How can you always win the game of snake?
This is a side project I completed that utilized Hamiltonian graphs and cycles to devise a solution to always win the game of Snake. I also created a Snake Bot program that would use backtracking to generate a path, given a NxN grid size, that you can always follow to win the game of Snake. A full discussion of our motivation and analysis are available in the PDF above.
